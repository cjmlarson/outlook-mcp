# Outlook MCP Tools - Testing Results & Documentation

## Testing Summary
All four Outlook MCP tools have been thoroughly tested and are working correctly with the Windows-optimized implementation.

### Test Results
✅ **outlook_list** - PASSED
- Lists accounts, folders, and items correctly
- Handles nested folder paths
- JSON output formatting works

✅ **outlook_filter** - PASSED  
- Filters by date range (days, since, until)
- Filters by sender
- Filters by type (email, event, contact, task)
- Unread filter works

✅ **outlook_search** - PASSED
- DASL query search works
- OR/AND operators function correctly
- Date filters apply properly
- Note: Requires folder path, not just account

✅ **outlook_read** - PASSED
- Reads email content correctly
- JSON output mode works
- Handles attachments metadata
- Note: JSON mode may have issues with certain email formats

✅ **Edge Cases** - PASSED
- Non-existent folders return appropriate errors
- Empty search results handled gracefully
- Invalid entry IDs return error messages

## Implementation Details

### Problem & Solution
**Initial Issue**: The original `server_direct.py` using `exec()` was hanging in Claude Desktop due to COM initialization issues when running Outlook scripts directly.

**Solution**: Created `server_windows.py` with Windows-optimized subprocess handling:
- Uses `py` command instead of `python` for better Windows compatibility
- Implements threading to prevent blocking
- Adds CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to avoid console popups
- Includes 30-second timeout protection
- Proper error handling and output capture

### Key Files
- `server_windows.py` - Windows-optimized MCP server implementation
- `main.py` - Entry point that imports server_windows
- `manifest.json` - Desktop Extension configuration

## Known Limitations

1. **Outlook Required**: Microsoft Outlook must be installed and configured with at least one account.

2. **Windows Only**: Uses Windows COM automation, not compatible with Mac/Linux.

3. **Unicode Handling**: Some special characters and emojis may be stripped from output to prevent encoding errors.

4. **Search Path Requirement**: The `outlook_search` tool requires a specific folder path, not just an account name. Use `outlook_list` first to find folder paths.

5. **JSON Read Mode**: The JSON output mode for `outlook_read` may not work with all email formats, particularly complex HTML emails.

6. **Performance**: Large folders (1000+ items) may take longer to process. Use count/limit parameters to control output size.

7. **Calendar Access**: Calendar filtering works but may have timezone-related issues with date comparisons.

8. **Python Version**: Requires Python 3.8+ (tested with Python 3.13.2).

## Installation Methods

### For Claude Desktop (One-Click)
```
1. Download outlook-mcp-2.0.0-windows.dxt
2. Double-click to install in Claude Desktop
3. Restart Claude Desktop
```

### For Claude Code (Developers)
```bash
# Option 1: Local project scope
claude mcp add -s local outlook-mcp py C:/path/to/outlook-mcp/desktop-extension/server/main.py

# Option 2: Global scope (all projects)
claude mcp add -s global outlook-mcp py C:/path/to/outlook-mcp/desktop-extension/server/main.py

# Option 3: From PyPI (when published)
pip install outlook-mcp
claude mcp add -s global outlook-mcp python -m outlook_mcp.server
```

## Testing Commands

### Quick Test
```bash
# Test the server directly
cd C:/Users/conno/compadre/outlook-mcp
python test_server_windows.py

# Run comprehensive test suite
python test_all_tools.py
```

### Manual Testing in Claude Code
After adding the MCP server:
```
claude mcp list  # Verify connection
```

Then in a Claude session, test with:
- "List my Outlook folders"
- "Show emails from the last 7 days"
- "Search for 'meeting' in my inbox"

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Connecting
1. Check Python is installed: `py --version`
2. Verify Outlook is running
3. Check MCP logs: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp-server-outlook-mcp.log`

### Tools Hanging
- This was fixed in server_windows.py with proper subprocess handling
- If still occurring, check Outlook isn't showing any dialog boxes

### Unicode Errors
- The tools use ASCII-safe encoding to prevent crashes
- Some special characters may be displayed as '?'

## Future Improvements
- Add support for sending emails
- Implement folder creation/deletion
- Add attachment download functionality
- Improve Unicode handling
- Add batch operations support
