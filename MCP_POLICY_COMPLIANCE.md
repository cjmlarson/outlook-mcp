# MCP Directory Policy Compliance Assessment
## Outlook MCP Server

### Overall Compliance Status: **MOSTLY COMPLIANT** with areas needing attention

---

## Safety and Security (Policies 1-6)

### ✅ Policy 1: Must not facilitate violations of Anthropic's Usage Policy
**COMPLIANT** - Server provides read-only access to local Outlook data. No capability for harmful activities.

### ✅ Policy 2: Must not evade or circumvent Claude's safety guardrails
**COMPLIANT** - No mechanisms to bypass safety features. Standard MCP tool implementation.

### ✅ Policy 3: Prioritize user privacy protection
**COMPLIANT** - All data stays local, no external transmission. Uses Windows COM automation with existing Outlook session.

### ✅ Policy 4: Only collect necessary user context data
**COMPLIANT** - No data collection. Only accesses data explicitly requested by user commands.

### ✅ Policy 5: Must not infringe on intellectual property rights
**COMPLIANT** - MIT licensed. No copyrighted content included.

### ✅ Policy 6: Cannot transfer money or execute financial transactions
**COMPLIANT** - Read-only Outlook access. No financial capabilities.

## Compatibility (Policies 7-12)

### ✅ Policy 7: Tool descriptions must clearly describe function and invocation
**COMPLIANT** - Each tool has clear description and parameter documentation in both JS and Python implementations.

### ✅ Policy 8: Tool descriptions must precisely match actual functionality
**COMPLIANT** - Descriptions accurately reflect read-only Outlook operations.

### ✅ Policy 9: Descriptions should not create confusion with other servers
**COMPLIANT** - Unique "outlook_" prefix for all tools. Clear Microsoft Outlook focus.

### ✅ Policy 10: Should not intentionally call or coerce other servers
**COMPLIANT** - Standalone implementation. No cross-server calls.

### ✅ Policy 11: Should not interfere with Claude calling other tools
**COMPLIANT** - Standard MCP implementation. No interference mechanisms.

### ✅ Policy 12: Should not dynamically pull external behavioral instructions
**COMPLIANT** - All behavior hardcoded. No external instruction fetching.

## Functionality (Policies 13-19)

### ✅ Policy 13: Deliver reliable performance with fast response times
**COMPLIANT** - Uses efficient COM automation and DASL queries. Pagination for large result sets.

### ✅ Policy 14: Gracefully handle errors with helpful feedback
**COMPLIANT** - Try-catch blocks throughout. Clear error messages.

### ✅ Policy 15: Be frugal with token usage
**COMPLIANT** - Pagination, result limits, and output modes to control data volume.

### ❌ Policy 16: Use secure OAuth 2.0 for remote authentication
**N/A** - Local-only server using Windows COM. No remote connections.

### ⚠️ Policy 17: Provide all required tool annotations
**PARTIAL** - Tools have descriptions but could improve with examples and edge cases.

### ✅ Policy 18: Support Streamable HTTP transport
**COMPLIANT** - Uses stdio transport via MCP SDK.

### ✅ Policy 19: Use current dependency versions
**COMPLIANT** - Uses latest @modelcontextprotocol/sdk and minimal dependencies.

---

## Developer Requirements (Policies 20-27)

### ❌ Policy 20: Provide clear privacy policy for data collection
**MISSING** - No privacy policy document. Should add PRIVACY.md clarifying local-only operation.

### ⚠️ Policy 21: Offer verified contact and support channels
**PARTIAL** - GitHub repo provided but no explicit support channels or issue templates.

### ✅ Policy 22: Document server functionality and troubleshooting
**COMPLIANT** - Comprehensive README with usage examples and troubleshooting section.

### ❌ Policy 23: Provide standard testing account
**N/A** - Requires user's own Outlook installation. Cannot provide test account.

### ✅ Policy 24: Demonstrate core functionality with examples
**COMPLIANT** - README includes multiple usage examples for each tool.

### ✅ Policy 25: Verify ownership of API endpoints
**N/A** - No external APIs. Uses local Windows COM only.

### ⚠️ Policy 26: Maintain server and address issues promptly
**NEEDS COMMITMENT** - Repository exists but needs commitment to maintenance.

### ❌ Policy 27: Agree to MCP Directory Terms
**ACTION REQUIRED** - Must formally agree to terms when submitting to directory.

## Recommendations for Full Compliance

### High Priority (Required for Directory):
1. **Add PRIVACY.md** - Create privacy policy explaining:
   - Local-only data access
   - No data collection or transmission
   - Windows COM automation scope

2. **Add SUPPORT.md** - Document support channels:
   - GitHub Issues for bug reports
   - Contact information
   - Response time expectations

3. **Create issue templates** - Add GitHub issue templates for:
   - Bug reports
   - Feature requests
   - Questions

4. **Agree to MCP Directory Terms** - Complete formal agreement when submitting

### Medium Priority (Improve Quality):
1. **Enhance tool annotations** - Add input/output examples to tool descriptions
2. **Add CONTRIBUTING.md** - Guidelines for contributors
3. **Create test documentation** - Explain how users can test with their own Outlook

### Low Priority (Nice to Have):
1. **Add performance benchmarks** - Document expected response times
2. **Create video tutorial** - Demonstrate setup and usage
3. **Add changelog** - Track version history

## Summary

The Outlook MCP server is **well-implemented** and follows most MCP policies. Key strengths:
- Clean, secure local-only architecture
- Clear tool descriptions and documentation
- Proper error handling
- MIT licensed open source

To achieve full compliance for MCP Directory submission:
1. Add privacy policy document
2. Formalize support channels
3. Agree to directory terms
4. Minor documentation improvements

The server provides valuable Outlook integration functionality while maintaining security and privacy through local-only operation.
